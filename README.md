# A Systematic Performative Comparison of Graph Database Systems

This repository contains the documents for our Summer Tehqiq Research Project II (STRP-II) at Habib University, as part of the Graduate School Curation Program (GSCP). The STRP-II is a 10-week long independant student research project under the supervision of a faculty member. Our research aims to conduct a performance based comparative analysis on existing graph database systems based on some benchmarks and metrics. By the end of the research, we aim to propose the better graph database system amongst the ones we've compared, and have produced a paper on our research.
